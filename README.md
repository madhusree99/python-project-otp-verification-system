# python-project-otp-verification-system
A Python-based One-Time Password (OTP) verification system that generates a 6-digit OTP and sends it to the userâ€™s email for secure verification. The system validates the OTP entered by the user and provides access only if the OTP matches. This project is designed to demonstrate secure authentication using Python's built-in libraries.
